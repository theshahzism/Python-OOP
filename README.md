# Python-OOP

This repository contains some pieces of codes written in second semester in CS-116 Object oriented programming.
Our instructors gave us some practice problems to prepare for quizzes, mid terms , and finals.

To prepare for our sessionals, in which I scored 40 out of 40, I solved the included practice problems to grasp a better understanding of OOP concepts.
